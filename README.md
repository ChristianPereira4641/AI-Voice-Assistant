# AI-Voice-Assistant
Developing an AI powered voice assistant from scratch

## Overview
This project is focused on developing an AI-powered voice assistant capable of understanding and responding to voice commands. The goal is to build an intelligent system that can process natural language, perform tasks, and interact with users in a conversational way.

## Status
ðŸš§ This project is currently in the early stages of development. ðŸš§

## Features in Development
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Using libraries such as `spaCy`, `NLTK`, or `Transformers` to parse and understand user input.
- **Speech Recognition**: Implementing a speech-to-text engine using `SpeechRecognition` or Google's Speech-to-Text API.
- **Voice Output**: Using a text-to-speech engine (`pyttsx3` or Google's Text-to-Speech API) for the assistantâ€™s responses.
- **AI Model**: Exploring pre-trained models for understanding intents and performing tasks such as setting reminders, answering queries, or controlling smart devices.

## Planned Features
- **Custom AI Model**: Training a model for specific use cases (e.g., controlling home automation, responding to queries about mechatronics).
- **Contextual Responses**: Implementing a system for multi-turn conversations, where the assistant can remember the context of the conversation.
- **Integration with Other Services**: Integrating with APIs like Google Calendar, weather APIs, and other IoT devices.

## Challenges
- Building an accurate and responsive NLP model.
- Real-time processing and low-latency responses.
- Creating a flexible, scalable architecture for voice processing.

## Future Ideas
- Adding support for different languages.
- Implementing machine learning for self-improvement and better conversation understanding.
- Creating a mobile or desktop interface for broader usability.

## Contributing
Feedback and contributions are welcome, especially around model training and integration with smart home systems.
